Website cloning refers to the copying or modification of an existing website design or script to create a new website. It reduces the development needed to create a website and allows designers to create websites without the need to write scripts from scratch.
Website cloning can be used to create a fully working copy of a website. This process will duplicate your WordPress pages, posts, databases, and other files.
There are many ways to clone a website. You can use a cloning plugin or manually clone your website.
In this way I have done clone website on Zomato-Website.
